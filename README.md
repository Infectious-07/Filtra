# BunnyBros-CodeSec
Repository for all assets from team Bunny Bros for the CodeSec competition


Design a project for the education sector - or anything to do with learning. This can be anything from innovating learning methods to making content easier to understand! You will be judged on:

• The idea proposed directly and effectively addresses the issue posed to the competitors, and gives an innovative proposal 

• The project has shown a clear intention and purpose behind actions, and an iterative process showing development is clearly seen 

• The project’s implementation will address the brief effectively and efficiently 

• The pitch is very convincing to the judges, and the team members are all included and integrated in a combined pitch 

• The code included has non-obvious implementation which improves function noticeably 

• The code included is fully commented, and the intention is immediately clear to the judges

Potential projects include AI powered educational platforms or teacher-assistant  apps.
